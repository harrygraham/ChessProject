# ChessProject
AQA A-Level Computing Project

A two player chess system with optional integrated maths revision. Written in full object oriented methodology, in C#.

I taught myself C# to write this project as the language was more suited the nature of the system. 
Visual Basic, the classroom taught language, I didn't feel was as suited to this task. 
As a result, I learnt a lot about the power of OO systems.


To USE:

Clone / download this repo and go into the bin/ directories and run the test_chess executable found there.
